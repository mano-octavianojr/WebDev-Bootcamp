/**
 * The Fibonacci Exercise
Fibonacci was an Italian mathematician who came up with the Fibonacci sequence:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 ...

Where every number is the sum of the two previous ones.

e.g. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 comes from

0 + 1 = 1

1 + 1 = 2

1 + 2 = 3

2 + 3 = 5

etc.

Create a function where you can call it by writing the code:

fibonacciGenerator (n)

Where n is the number of items in the sequence.

So I should be able to call:

fibonacciGenerator(3) and get

[0,1,1]

as the output.

IMPORTANT: The solution checker is expecting an array as the correct output.

Do NOT change any of the existing code.

You do NOT need any alerts or prompts, the result should be returned from the function as an output.

The first two numbers in the sequence must be 0 and 1.

Also, if you decide to create a for loop, make sure you explicitly specify var i = 0 rather than simply writing i = 0 . This is a quirk of the testing suite.

e.g. for (var i = 0; i < 10; i ++)

function fibonacciGenerator(n) {
    //Do NOT change any of the code above ðŸ‘†

    //Write your code here:

    var array = [];
    var temp = 0;
    var left_val = 0;
    var right_val = 1;
    array.push(left_val);
    array.push(right_val);

    if (n == 1) { return [0]; }

    for (var counter = 2; counter < n; counter++) {

        temp = left_val;
        left_val = right_val;
        right_val = temp + right_val;
        array.push(right_val);
    }
    return array;



    //Return an array of fibonacci numbers starting from 0.

    //Do NOT change any of the code below ðŸ‘‡
}
